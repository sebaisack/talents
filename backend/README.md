# Backend documentation

This directory contains the Django backend for the Talent in School Management System.

## Application modules

- `config` – project settings, database configuration, JWT auth, and root URL registration
- `core` – country, zone, region, district, ward, school, user, talent, club, announcement, and evaluation models
- `students` – student and parent models, serializers, and scoped viewsets
- `competitions` – competition lifecycle, participation records, and judging logic
- `results` – result records, ranking, detail entries, promotions, and approval workflow

# Linux/macOS
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows

## Notes

The repository includes a working Django API and a separate React frontend application. The backend documentation reflects the actual implementation in the codebase, including the permission model, router registration, and model relationships currently present in the project.

## Production deployment and initial data

The backend container applies Django migrations and runs `manage.py seed_initial_data` before starting Gunicorn. The command seeds school ownership types, talent categories, Tanzania's zone/region/district/ward hierarchy, country clubs, and the real Sengerema school records. It is safe to run again when the container restarts.

The `populate/sample.py`, `populate/tempdata.py`, `backend/students/populate_students.py`, and `populate/createtalentadmin.py` scripts are not run during production startup. They create demo accounts/data or use a fixed password and should not be seeded into a live database. Django data migrations continue to run as part of `migrate`.
